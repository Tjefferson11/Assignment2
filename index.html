                    As expected, places near the airport are pretty crowded with listings

                    categorised as outliers. Manhattan and Brooklyn had the highest overall listings price per night
                    compared to other Borough. There is not much significant trend spotted for Manhattan and Brooklyn 
                    beside the price tends to increase slightly during past few months. There seems to be upward 
                    pressure for listings in Queens and Staten Island throuhgout the year. During June-July in both 2020
                    and 2021, spotted higher prices of listings compared to other months, justifies holiday peak season

                    Total listngs in log scale, and Projected population by NYC Government. The purpose on doing logarithm scale 
                    is to cover the skewness of the data observation distribution.
                    Not surprising, the bigger the population is (sze), the bigger the total Airbnb listings on a certain neighbourhood, vice versa.
                    All five borough seems to have similar average listings price across all neighbourhhod, however, 
                    there is spotted an outliers from Staten Island Borough  with an average listings price reach $500 - $1000 dollars per night. 
                    Listings in Manhattan seems to have a slight higher price compared to other Borough due to its popularity 
                    and business district in tourist point of view.

                    The second stretchable Bubble chart stressed on the realtion of normal scale average price of NYC Airbnb listings, the progression of time, and 
                    the number of reviews each neighbourhood received. In terms of occupancy hinted from the last review date, all five borough 
                    had significantly more people staying in Airbnb in 2020- 2021, despite covid-19, the Airbnb sector does not fall 
                    drastically. In addition there is a pattern showing the increase on listings price after covid-19 breakout, or after the year 2020. 
                    The number of reviews per neighbourhood are scattered evenly.
                    Interestingly, there are some outliers listings, wehre it had small number of reviews, but listed at very high price, 
                    in all of the Borough states. This might justifies the facts that since it was an expensive listings,
                    not many people stayed there, hence, no reviews.
